# Mastermind in Haskell

A long long time ago I wrote a Mastermind game in Pascal.
And I recently watched a video of Peter Marks about
[lazy evaluation in Haskell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSrVC4-p7aI).
Mastermind is used as an example of lazy evaluation.

So here is my own version...

- the source code in Literate Haskell: [mastermind.lhs](mastermind.lhs)
- the document rendered in Markdown: [mastermind.md](mastermind.md)
